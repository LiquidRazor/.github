# LiquidRazor Organization

Welcome to **LiquidRazor** â€” a home for lightweight, developer-friendly PHP tools, bundles, and libraries.  
Our focus: build fast, slim, and powerful backends that stay **transparent, predictable, and fun** to work with.

## ðŸš€ Core Project

### [LiquidApi](https://github.com/LiquidRazor/LiquidApi)
A minimal **Symfony API skeleton**, powered by the [DTOApi Bundle](https://github.com/LiquidRazor/DTOApi).  
LiquidApi provides:

- **DTO-first design** â†’ predictable contracts, validation, and serialization out of the box.  
- **OpenAPI/Swagger docs** â†’ instant documentation and typed client generation.  
- **Slim API footprint** â†’ no framework bloat, just what you need for production-ready APIs.  
- **Flex-recipe ready** â†’ `composer create-project liquidrazor/liquidapi my-api` spins up a working skeleton instantly.  

Itâ€™s the perfect foundation for modern React/Next frontends, mobile apps, or service-to-service APIs.

## ðŸ§© Extensions & Custom Bundles

The organization will grow around **LiquidApi** with:

- ðŸ”Œ **Custom Symfony bundles** â€” drop-in features you can plug into your API.  
- ðŸ“¦ **Shared libraries** â€” focused utilities and helpers for API development.  
- ðŸ›  **Developer tooling** â€” configs, workflows, and recipes to make Symfony DX smoother.

## ðŸ—º Philosophy

We believe in:
- **Simplicity over magic** â†’ understand what runs under the hood.  
- **Contracts first** â†’ DTOs and OpenAPI specs as the single source of truth.  
- **Flexibility** â†’ each bundle/library is independent and reusable.  
- **Community friendliness** â†’ everything open source, documented, and tested.
